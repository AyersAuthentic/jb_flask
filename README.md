# Job Board Website

## Project Overview

This project is a simple job board website I built to learn Python's Flask framework and Bootstrap. It provides basic functionality for users to post and view job listings, serving as a practical way to understand web development concepts.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their job postings.
- **Job Posting:** Allows users to post new job listings with descriptions.
- **Job Browsing:** Users can view and search for available jobs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask:** Handles server-side operations.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for responsive frontend design.
- **SQLite:** Database for storing user and job data.
